# signac - MICDE Symposium of the Center for Network and Storage Enabled Collaborative Computational Science 2018

## About
This repository contains slides and demos for the session ["Reproducible computational workflows with signac"](https://indico.cern.ch/event/692449/contributions/3170022/) held at the [2018 Symposium of the Center for Network and Storage Enabled Collaborative Computational Science](https://indico.cern.ch/event/692449/).

The **signac** framework is a collection of Python packages that are designed to automate computational investigations and manage the underlying data spaces. The framework is lightweight and easy to integrate with other tools.
